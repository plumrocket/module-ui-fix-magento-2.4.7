# Magento 2.4.7 WYSIWYG Editor Fix Extension

The extension allows you to fix the Magento 2.4.7 WYSIWYG editor bug, enabling multiple editors to function seamlessly on the same page.
### Issues Fixed:
- **Content Saving Issue**: Fields filled by multiple editors on the same page are not saved correctly. Only the first editor saves data, while the others remain empty.
- **Display Errors**: The editor elements, such as the "Show/Hide Editor" button, are missing or non-functional.
